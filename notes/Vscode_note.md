# VSCode 使用说明书

1. 格式化代码

The code formatting is available in VS Code through the following shortcuts:

        On Windows Shift + Alt + F
        On Mac Shift + Option + F
        On Ubuntu Ctrl + Shift + I

Alternatively, you can find the shortcut, as well as other shortcuts, through the search functionality provided in the editor with Ctrl +Shift+ P (or Command + Shift + P on Mac), and then searching for format document.
